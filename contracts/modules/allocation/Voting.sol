This module allows eligible voters to cast a vote and subsequently calculates those votes for
a given strategy.

Examples:

    - Donation voting with offchain calculation
    - Simple voting with simple calculation
    - Credit voting (eligible voters receive X number of vote credits to distribute)
    - Governance token voting â€” the number of tokens you hold == the number of vote credits you can spend
