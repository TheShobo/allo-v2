This module provides the fund allocation for a given strategy pool of funds.

Examples:

    - Proportional distribution (the calculated proportion of votes = the proportion of the pool each recipient gets)
    - Winner take all
    - Ranked places (i.e. only top X projects receive discrete funding amounts)
    - Discrete sum â€” as long as project receives at or above a given threshold for proportion of votes than they receive a specific amount of funds
